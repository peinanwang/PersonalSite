						<h1>About Patrick<br /></h1>
						<p>MSCS Student --> SDE | Full-stack developer | Data Scientist</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						Patrick Peinan Wang is currently enrolled in the Master of Science in Computer Science program
						at Northeastern University's Vancouver regional campus. He is a passionate self-starter in
						computer sciences, and his studies are focused on full-stack development, artificial
						intelligence, and machine learning.
					</p>

					<p>
						Patrick built this website to share his projects and work achievements. The current postings
						cover software applications and some small data analytics side projects that Patrick worked on.
						Please feel free to check out the postings and the relevant GitHub pages or PDFs if you are
						interested to learn more.
					</p>

					<p>
						Patrick earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Forestry from the University of British Columbia
						in 2017. Before deciding to transition into the tech field, Patrick had spent several years
						working in Canada's natural resources sector. He worked on forest layout and road engineering,
						fire management, and ecosystem assessments, and provided other operational support for
						governments and private forest licensees.
					</p>

					<p>
						Besides his forestry background, Patrick is also a licensed Immigration Consultant. As an
						immigrant to Canada, he sees this as a perfect sideline business to work on in his spare time.
						Over the past two years, Patrick has provided customized and streamlined visa/immigration
						services for foreign workers, international students, refugees, and many others who love to live
						in Canada. Patrick used to work for a local immigration firm in Vancouver, and he is now running
						his own sole proprietorship.
